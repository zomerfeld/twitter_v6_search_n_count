High level architecture and IxD was done by designers, often as what @brownorama calls "wireflows" https://t.co/IjBTgssZdH
That meant the bulk of the most nuanced behavior choices were designed by product, not design.
As a FYI, most common scenario where I've worked. PM writes a spec which documents behavior, designers make comps, all collected in a wiki.
